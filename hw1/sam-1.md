The cross product of two vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ gives us the area of the parallelogram that they form. Half of this area gives us the area formed between the two vectors. 
The polarity of the cross product is determined by the orientation of the two vectors since 
$v_1 \times v_2 = -(v_2 \times v_1)$.

For each pair of points $p_i$ and $p_{i-1}$ that share an edge, the formula finds the cross product of the vectors from the origin to those points. e.g.
$$(x_i,y_i) \times (x_{i-1},y_{i-1}) = (x_i y_{i-1} - x_{i-1} y_i)$$
It then sums each of these cross-products and scales by $1/2$.
This leaves us with the area within the polygon. The orientation of the points correctly add and subtract the areas.

For a triangle ($p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$), let $v_1$ be the vector from the origin to $p_1$, $v_2$ be the vector from origin to $p_2$, and $v_3$ be the vector from origin to $p_3$.
